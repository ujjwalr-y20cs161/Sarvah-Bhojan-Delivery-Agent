# Sarva Bhojan [Food for All] Delivery Agent Application

Welcome to the Sarva Bhojan [Food for All] Delivery Agent Application repository! This mobile application is designed to empower delivery agents to efficiently manage delivery requests and contribute to the reach of Community Kitchens.

## Problem Statement:

**Problem:**
Community Kitchens run by Self Help Groups (SHGs) are essential during COVID-19 and for working-class people. However, SHGs struggle to reach their potential customers.

**Solution:**
Mobilizing community kitchen services to a digital platform can increase reach. The Sarva Bhojan project addresses this by creating a digital platform where SHGs can post food offerings, and customers can easily order and receive their meals. Additionally, the platform provides employment opportunities for unemployed youth as delivery agents, who can safely deliver prepared food.

## Project Overview:

The Sarva Bhojan Project is divided into four main parts for implementation:

1. **Main User Application**
2. **Community Kitchen Dashboard**
3. **Delivery Agent Application**
4. **Backend**
